## Problem Description
From the [competition Kaggle page][2]:
> There are hundreds of thousands new products added to Shopee every day. To make relevant products easily discoverable, one fundamental challenge is to accurately extract relevant information from a large volume of products. For the National Data Science Challenge (NDSC) 2019 , we present this real-world challenge of building an automatic solution to extract product related information through machine learning techniques.
>
> The theme of NDSC 2019 is Product Information Extraction in the Wild - a challenge to build up:
>
> `an automatic solution to extract product related information from large volume of images and free text data.`
>
> There will be two main competitions: beginner product category classification and advanced product information extraction. Participants may enter either (or both) of these two competitions and can choose to tackle any (or all) of the data sources provided on the Data pages: Beginner Category and Advanced Category.
>
> On this Kaggle page, we introduce the junior-level product category classification task with beginner category information. Participants are required to determine the category of a product given its image and title. For those who are also interested in advanced task using Advanced Category data, please refer to Product Information Extraction Kaggle page for more details.
